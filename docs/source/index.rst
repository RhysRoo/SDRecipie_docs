WasteAway: Your Personal Food Waste Management App
==================================================

**Overview**
WasteAway is a mobile application designed to help users manage food waste effectively. After creating an account and connecting to our database, users gain access to a variety of features designed to make food waste management simple and intuitive.

Upon entering the homepage, users are greeted with an introductory video that guides them through the app's navigation. An easy-to-understand app drawer, complete with icons, provides quick access to all pages. A sign-out button is also available for users to log out and return to the login page.

**Technology Stack**
Our app leverages the power of the Flutter framework and Firebase database:

- **Flutter** is a cross-platform mobile development framework that allows for a single codebase written in just one language. This not only reduces development costs but also supports hot reloading for a seamless user experience.

- **Firebase** is our chosen backend database, known for its scalability and real-time data syncing capabilities.


**How to Run the Application**

To run the application there is 2 ways this can be done:
 *Change the directory to match the folder that holds all the apps components (in terminal -> cd SDrecipe -> cd recipe_app) then (in terminal -> flutter run recipe_app)
 *Locate the main.dart from the lib folder -> choose debugger 

.. note::

   WasteAway is currently under active development. Stay tuned for updates!
