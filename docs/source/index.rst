===================================
Welcome to Wasteaway's documentation!
===================================

**What is the Application:**
Wasteaway is a mobile application that allows the user first to create an account connecting to the database. Once the account is created and all the details are validated. The user will be able to grant access to the application. When the user enters the homepage, there will be an introduction video directing the user on how to navigate through the pages. 

There is an app draw that displays all the buttons of the the pages in an easy-to-understand format with icons. A sign_out button also takes the user off the homepage and back to the login page in a logged-out state.

**Framework** (/Flutter/) is a cross-platform mobile development framework that allows a single codebase to be written in just one language. This is good as it saves development costs and supports hot reloading.

**Database** (/Firebase/) is a database used in the backend of the application.
