Creating Recipes
----------------

On this page, you can create recipes by following these steps:

1. **Naming the Recipe**: You can name your recipe anything you want.

2. **Entering Food Restrictions**: You will be required to enter any food restrictions you may have, such as vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, etc.

3. **Entering Ingredients**: You will need to enter the ingredients you want to use in your recipe.

4. **Entering Units**: After entering the ingredients, you will need to specify the units for each ingredient, such as weight (cups, grams, etc.).

Checking Ingredients
--------------------

Once you're finished, click the plus button to send the query. The ingredients will be checked with an API to verify their validity. This ensures that the ingredients are valid and can be matched with active ingredients to be made into recipes.
